SailNotes will be an application designed to provide a solution to the problem of unmotivated notetakers, and accessability of notes in the future. 

Outline form -initial draft to my solution/product:

Event page: 
- Date auto-loads and an optional title for the day
- Space to record location and if regatta/practice
- Link to results, yacht club etc.. if regatta
- Space for typed notes- made so it can be optional- 
- Color options included
- Dropdowns for inserting various wind strengths, waves, directions, etc…
- Applies to boat setup 
- SIMPLE as possible
- Space for easy diagrams, uploaded or drawn
- Paper scanner for physical notebook
- Space for youtube/uploaded videos to go, illustrating concepts
- The videos can be directly referenced “tied” to in the notes
- Space for weather conditions
- Applies to external factors, storms, clouds etc
- Space for coaching specific tips- feedback or things you liked about a guest coach
- After submitting the notes, the reward system would give ranking, which could be used in a competition among team members- 
- Also a streak feature, to see who could be the most consistent with it. 
- Prizes and badges?
  
File system:
- Join feature for a group of people who are taking notes about the same thing.
- After submitting a day’s notes, they get sent to a storage system, sorted by date. 
- Users have an option to search their archive
- Location, Date, Title, all search options
- Coach would have access to each person’s file system
- Users can choose which notes should be shared with the coach, after the season expires.
- *event page and files will be the only user-accessible screens
  
Notifications:
- Daily reminders on practice days to take notes
- Streak notifications
- Tentative ideas:
- Recording option, upload voice recordings to listen to in the future.
- Apple pencil usage? Will research how it may affect the system.
